## Getting Started

These instructions will help you get the project up and running on your local machine.

Run the following command lines:
```shell

It might take a little while to compile and install. After compilation is done, itâ€™ll give you some instructions to finish setting it up.

To get the project on your local machine, you should [fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) from the  [renocollective/member-portal](https://github.com/renocollective/member-portal) repository.

Once you have forked the project, clone this git repository by running:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/member-portal
```
Now you should have a local copy of the member-portal project.

Before you can successfully run the project, you need install all the dependencies for the Rail application by running:
```shell
bundle install
```
To successfully run this command, you will need to have bundler installed. To install bundler:
```shell
gem install bundler
```

Next, run:
```shell
rails db:migrate
```

To start and run the rails application:
```shell
rails s
```
Now you should be able to view the rails app at http://localhost:3000/
